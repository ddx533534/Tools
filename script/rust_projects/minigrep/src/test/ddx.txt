Longevity does not mean living forever.
Or even to age 120, or 150, which some self-proclaimed experts are now routinely promising to their followers.
Barring some major breakthrough that,somehow, someway,
reverses two billion years of evolutionary history and frees us from time’s arrow, everyone and everything that is alive today will inevitably die.
It’s a one-way street.
